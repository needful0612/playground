Playground

This repository is my personal sandbox for experiments, prototypes, and learning projects.

Purpose

Try out new ideas quickly

Test libraries, frameworks, and algorithms

Build small proof-of-concepts before formal projects

or just mess around with the concepts I've learned

Notes

Expect inconsistent code quality (some scripts are rough drafts).

Projects here may not be maintained long-term.

If something looks useful, feel free to fork or adapt.
